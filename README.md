# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis of the PyBer ride data is to provide insight into the differences in the number of rides, number of drivers, and ride fares between urban, suburban, and rural city types. Data visualizations have been added to create a clearer picture of the differences between the city types so that decision-makers at PyBer can address the disparities between the city types.
