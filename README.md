# PyBer Analysis
## Overview

The purpose of this analysis of the PyBer ride data is to provide insight into the differences in the number of rides, number of drivers, and ride fares between urban, suburban, and rural city types. Data visualizations have been added to create a clearer picture of the differences between the city types so that decision-makers at PyBer can address the disparities between the city types.  
# Results

The results show that the vast majority of the total fares, rides, and drivers is comprised of data from the urban city type.

While the majority of the data is from the urban city type, the fare averages per ride and per driver are each higher in the suburban and rural city types.

The average fare per ride in urban, suburban, and rural cities is $24.53, $30.97, $34.62 respectively. The average fare per driver in urban, suburban, and rural cities is $16.57, $39.50, and $55.49 respectively. 
## Influence of City Type

The multiple line chart above shows that weekly fares for each city type from January to April 2019. For all three city types, the first week of first week of January is a low point. The third week of February is a peak for all three cities types while the rural city type's highest output was the first week of April. 
# Summary

Across the board, there urban city provides the most data but lower average fares per ride and drivers. Unless suburban and rural rides are longer (data that we do not have) then there need to be solutions to address the disparities between city type so that rides are more affordable for riders and so that drivers have more suport. 
## Recommendations

The first recommendation is to provide more driver support to the suburban and rural city types. More drivers could assist in improving the rider experience by reducing wait times. 
Secondly, unless suburban and rural riders are taking significantly longer rides, there should be should a discounted rate based on the distant of rides. Rides over 30 minutes should have a discounted fare as the rides get longer. This may even encourage suburban and rural riders to request more rides. 
Lastly, the urban cities seem to be thriving from the data but there can certainly be improvements to facilitate a better experience for drivers and to cover the impact of reducing fares for longer trips. There should be a increased initial rate for trips that are requested in heavily populated areas so that drivers are slightly rewarded for providing service to these areas.
